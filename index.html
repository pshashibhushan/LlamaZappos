        <h3>Origin of Llama</h3>
        <p>The llama is native to the high puna of the South American Andes. Peru and Bolivia form the heart of this region with portions of Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador forming the periphery. The llama is one of the four species known as New World camelids which inhabit the region. The other species are the alpaca, the guanaco, and the vicuna. All four species are thought to have originated from a common North American ancestor who is also the supposed predecessor of the African and Asian camels. It is presumed that migration northward across the Bering land bridge into Asia formed the ancestry of the Old World camelids (Bactrian and Dromedary). These camelids became highly adapted to desert climatic conditions.</p>

        <h3>Llama Facts</h3>
        <p>The llama is thought to have evolved from the old world camel-like animals that inhabited the regions that is today the Middle East. Although the llama has many similarities to the camel, the most noticeable difference between the llama and the camel is that the llama does not have a hump on its back.Llamas are very sociable animals and enjoy being with other llamas in a herd. The llama is also believed to be a particularly intelligent animal as llamas are commonly taught tasks which the llama picks up with only a few repetitions of the task.</p>

        <h3>Llama - FAQs</h3>
        <p>Llamas are excellent fiber producers too. They usually have a dual fiber fleece, however, which includes 80-100% fine crimpy fluff and 20-0% straight coarse guard hair. The fiber is hollow, making it excellent for creating warm clothing. It is also oil free and has no inherent odor. The qualities make this fiber a spinner's dream, and it may be felted as well. The amount of fiber varies from animal to animal, but an average is about 2-5#s per year.  Most llamas would need shearing every other year, some every year, and some every third year.</p>

        <h3 class="featurette-heading">Llama - A Great Friend</h3>
        <p>Llamas are great friends to have when you want to head to the high country for a little camping and back-country trekking. Because of their soft foot 
          (two toes, with toenails) they leave no scars on the trail. Because they are modified ruminants, their fecal matter comes as very well digested, almost odorless pellets. They can usually browse for their food as they go along the trail. All in all, they fit into the mountain trail or back-country  environment very well.</p>

        <h3 class="featurette-heading">Llama - A guard animal</h3>
        <p> Llamas have been used very successfully as guard animals for sheep, goats, and miniature horses. They are very intelligent and curious, and have the ability to recognize family pets, neighbors' pets, and the difference between them and coyotes. Their curious nature and athletic ability bring them into close proximity to the coyote, causing the coyote to turn tail.  Gelded males are preferred as guard animals. They work best without other llamas, in this case, adopting the herd of sheep (goats, miniature horses, cattle) as their "own" herd.</p>
